.. title:: idl-emcee Overview

`idl_emcee <https://mcfit.github.io/idl_emcee>` is an `Interactive Data Language <http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandSolutions/GeospatialProducts/IDL.aspx>` (IDL)/`GNU Data Language <http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/>` (GDL) implementation of the `affine-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler`, based on `sl_emcee <https://github.com/mcfit/sl_emcee>` by `M. A. Nowak <http://space.mit.edu/home/mnowak/isis_vs_xspec/>`, an S-Lang/`ISIS <http://space.mit.edu/cxc/isis/>` implementation of the MCMC Hammer proposed by `Goodman & Weare (2010) <http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/camcos.2010.5.65>`, and then implemented in Python (`emcee <https://github.com/dfm/emcee>`) by `Foreman-Mackey et al.

    - OS X (`brew <https://brew.sh/>`)::

        brew tap brewsci/science
        brew install gnudatalanguage

    - OS X (`macports <https://www.macports.org/>`)::

        sudo port selfupdate
        sudo port upgrade libtool
        sudo port install gnudatalanguage
    
    - Windows: using the `GNU Data Language for Win32 <https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudatalanguage-win32/>` (Unofficial Version) or compiling the `GitHub source <https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl>` with Visual Studio 2015 as seen in `appveyor.yml <https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl/blob/master/appveyor.yml>`.
